# Overview
**Cosmology**: the study of the structure, origin, and evolution of the universe.  
* Modern framework: *Hot big bang theory*, universe expands and cools down.
* Model-dependent interpretations: only 1 observable universe.
* Time-scale: 14 billion years old

Important issues:
1. Dark matter and dark energy
2. Inflation
3. Baryogenesis
  
**Cosmological Redshift**: as the universe expends, spectra from distant galaxies shifted towards longer wavelengths.  

In homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model, the expansion is described by a time-dependent scale factor $a(t)$.  

About 14 billion years ago, at the **singularity** (time origin $t=0$), the scale factor $a(t) \to 0$ and the density of the universe $\rho \to \infty$. This is found by general relativity and the observed present expansion rate, $H\equiv \dot a /a$ (More later).  

At Planck density $\rho_{\text{PI}} \sim 10^{97} \mathrm{kg/m^3}$, quantum gravity effects are large. To describe this **Planck era**, we need a theory of quantum gravity. We don't know what happened at $t=0$ or at the immediate vicinity of *Planck time* $10^{-42}\mathrm{s}$.
