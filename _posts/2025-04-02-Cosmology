# Overview
**Cosmology**: the study of the structure, origin, and evolution of the universe.  
* Modern framework: *Hot big bang theory*, universe expands and cools down.
* Model-dependent interpretations: only 1 observable universe.
* Time-scale: 14 billion years old
Important issues
1. Dark matter and dark energy
2. Inflation
3. Baryogenesis
**Cosmological Redshift**: as the universe expends, spectra from distant galaxies shifted towards longer wavelengths.
In homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model, the expansion is described by a time-dependent scale factor $a(t)$. 
About 14 billion years ago, at the **singularity** (time origin $t=0$), the scale factor $a(t) \to 0$ and the density of the universe $\rho \to \infty$. This is found by general relativity and the observed present expansion rate, $H\equiv \dot a /a$ (More later). 
At Planck density $\rho_{\text{PI}} \sim 10^{97} \,\text{kg/m^3}
